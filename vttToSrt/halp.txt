Converts WebVTT files to SRT

vttToSrt [-h] [-q] [-v] [-f] [-s <string>] [-e <string>] [-r] <string> <string>

  -h, --help --haaalp
    Displays this help-file.

  -q --quiet
    Mutes all non error messages.
    Overrides -v.

  -v --verbose
     More detailed output.

  -f --force --plz
    Forces files to be written even if they allready exist 
    (normally files will not get overwritten).

  -s <string> --search <string>
    Tells the program to search for files with the "*.vtt" extention 
    (or the one defined by -e) and convert them.

  -e <string> --extention <string>
    Defines a custom extention for -s to search for instead of the default 
    "*.vtt" (make shure they are actually WebVTT files).

  -r --recurse
    Tells -s to do a recursive search instead of the default flat one.

  <string>
    The file to be converted.
    This field is ignored if -s is used.

  <string>
    Defines the output filename.
    By default the same filename as the input is used (with .srt extention).
    This field is ignored if -s is used.

Examples:
  vttToSrt derp.vtt
    Converts "derp.vtt" to "derp.srt".

  vttToSrt derp.vtt derpinator.lozor
    Converts "derp.vtt" to "derpinator.lozor".

  vttToSrt -s movies -e awesomesubformat -r -v
    Converts all WebVTT files (here wit the "awesomesubformat" extention) 
    to srt recursively and with additional output.
	
  vttToSrt -f derp.vtt
    Converts "derp.vtt" to "derp.srt" and overwrites the existing file.
